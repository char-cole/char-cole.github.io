The family Zopheridae has no common name; it has grown considerably in recent years. Previously, the Ironclad Beetles of subfamily Zopherinae were considered to be the entire family, but now there are up to 6 subfamilies depending on the author.

Ironclad beetles are so named for the incredible durability of their exoskeletons - some of the hardest of all arthropods. It can be genuinely difficult to crush or pierce an ironclad beetle, and they have been reported to survive being run over by cars. However, I strongly advise against testing the durability of living specimens.
