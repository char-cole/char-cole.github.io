Green lacewings, or common lacewings, are predatory insects and considered beneficial. Common lacewings are extremely numerous and prolific with worldwide distribution. Adults can be identified by their large eyes and they wings, which are largely translucent and threaded with net-like (hence: neuroptera, net-wings) veins.

Larvae of this family are called junk bugs for their particular camouflage strategy: they carry on their backs an accumulation of debris, including body parts of their prey. This hides their body almost entirely and makes them appear exactly like lifeless debris except for their movement.

In addition to their beautiful wings, lacewings lay elegant eggs on long, thin stalks.
