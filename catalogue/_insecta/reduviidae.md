Assassin bugs (family Reduviidae) are "true bugs" - members of order Hemiptera (meaning
"half-winged"). They are named for their long proboscis which
they use to impale other animals from ambush.

There are many species of assassin bugs, and it's difficult for a layperson to
identify them confidently because they change shape and color in different life
stages (this is true of many insect groups). For a long time, I was unsure if I
was seeing multiple species of assassin bugs, but I was fortunate in spring 2022
to get shots of groups of milkweed assassin bugs in a variety of stages of
growth.

By comparing young nymphs, older nymphs, and imagos side-by-side, it becomes
apparent that these are all the same species. As it turns out, most of the
assassin bugs I have seen are all various morphs of the milkweed assassin bug,
_Zelus longpipes_ Linnaeus. These creatures roughly triple in size of the course of their nymphal stage.
