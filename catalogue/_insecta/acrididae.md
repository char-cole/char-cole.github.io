This family comprises the majority of grasshopper species. Acrididae is distinguished by relatively short antennae, hence the name. Notably, all locusts are members of this family, a locust being any species of grasshopper with the ability to morph into a swarming phase in the presence of suitable conditions (primarily, abundant vegetation growth after a period of drought). Swarming evolved independently in multiple subfamilies of Acrididae and has had major economic and psychological impacts on human society since prehistory.
