Wolf Spiders are "ground active hunters," but unlike their namesake they are solo hunters, not pack hunters. Many laypersons hear the name "wolf spider" and imagine something far from the truth: most species are small to medium in size; none are particularly hairy; and their shape is fairly generic for a spider.

Wolf spiders are famous for their unique parenting style. After birth, spiderlings cling to the mother's body, riding along until they are large enough to hunt on their own.
