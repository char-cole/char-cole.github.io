These spiders are often quite distinctive, usually having many large leg spines. Like their namesake, they are ambush hunters known to pounce on their prey. Lynx spiders are known as "other active hunters," meaning they do not run along the ground, but traverse three-dimensional space such as plants and structures to catch their prey.
