This family of spiders is large and diverse, and is also known by the common names "cobweb spiders" and "comb-footed spiders". Only the latter accurately describes the entire family, due to a comb-like structure of bristles on their fourth leg. The other names refer to messy-looking space webs that most species create; however, members of this family actually create a variety of web forms.

The most famous members of this family are the so-called widow spiders of genus _Latrodectus_, specifically the black widows. Certain widow spiders are medically significant: their venom can significantly harm or even kill a human. Frustratingly, they also have an unusual affinity for human structures, giving us a true cause for wariness. **Always use caution around any widow spider**, and **any bite by a widow spider should be seen by a trained medical professional**.

That said, the widow spiders (especially of North America) are not aggressive and rarely bite humans. Even if one is bitten, serious damage is unlikely and medical treatment is rarely necessary. The primary treatment is pain relief.
