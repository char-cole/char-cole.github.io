Spiders of this family do not spin webs for hunting, only for travel or reproduction. Most are ambush hunters, and the best known use known as flower crab spiders because they use camouflage to hide on flowers and eat pollinators. Some wait on other plant parts or in the open, and some are even active hunters.

The name crab spider comes from their elongated first and second legs, giving a crablike appearance. While many spiders have the capacity to change color based on their diet, some crab spiders are apparently able to change their color for the specific purpose of camouflage with their surroundings.
