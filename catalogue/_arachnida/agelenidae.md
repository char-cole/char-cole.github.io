Members of Agelenidae, the funnel weaver spiders, create layered sheet webs of non-sticky silk. They wait inside their homes until they sense the motion of prey touching the webs, at which time they use their tremendous running speed to rush out and capture their prey. Should they sense something larger than their prey touching the web (say, a human bumping into it), they recognize the danger and rush backward, deeper into their web an away from danger.
