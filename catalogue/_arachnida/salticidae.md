Salticids have a unique and recognizable form. With a large pair of anterior median (central, forward-facing) eyes, most jumping spider species are considered exceptionally cute. They can also be distinguished by their behavior; they are highly active and curious. They can still be skittish if startled or threatened, but they move quickly, frequently, and with intent. As active hunters, they must continually seek prey.

Jumping spiders are also exceptionally intelligent and sharp-eyed. Even though all spiders have six or eight eyes, most actually have very poor vision; Salticidae on the other hand has vision better than many creatures orders of magnitude larger. And jumping spiders have been observed making visual assessments of prey in a 3D environment and planning approach routes that avoid the prey's own lines of sight.

The Salticidae family is also the largest of all spider families. Jumping spiders are extraordinarily successful and are beloved for their rich coloration and, in some cases, delightfully complex courtship behavior.
