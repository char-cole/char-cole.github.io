Spiders (order Araneae) are the best-known members of class Arachnida, and many
people know scorpions (order Scorpiones) are also arachnids, but in fact there
are several smaller, more obscure orders included in this class. These creatures
are fewer and less widespread, and identification resources can be difficult to
find.
