<h1>Spidering on the Web</h1>

<p>
    Thanks for coming here. I'm in the process of collecting my photos and
    journals into a blog format. Here's a few pictures of spiders for you to
    enjoy in the meantime.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
    {% assign image_files = site.static_files | where: "image", true %} {% for
    myimage in image_files %}
    <image
        src="{{myimage.path}}"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        style="margin: 1rem;"
    />
    {% endfor %}
</div>
