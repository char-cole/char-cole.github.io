<h1>Photography Blog</h1>

<p style="padding: 0.5rem; background-color: #e5a5a5; border-radius: 0.25rem">
    Welcome to my photo blog! This is a new project for me and I'm still in the
    process of organizing old photos into blog posts with context. There may not
    be much content yet, but I have plenty of photos to share!
</p>

<p>
    This is my photography blog, where I will share and describe some of my
    favorite photos. Almost all of my photography is "macro", meaning
    high-magnification photos of very small things.
</p>

<p>
    The most common subject of my blog is spiders. Some posts will be be about
    insects, gastropods, or microbes. Actually, hymenoptera (wasps, ants, and
    bees) and coleoptera (beetles) are some of my favorite creatures. But
    spiders make a better hobby for several reasons: they are
    common in wide variety, they are badly misunderstood, and identification
    resources are much more widely available.
</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>
    Most of my photos were taken on a Pixel 3 or Pixel 5. Some of those were
    additionally taken through a 10x magnification hand lens - these are
    typically distinguishable by a very shallow focus (where most of the subject
    will be out of focus and the background will have pronounced bokeh).
</p>

<p>
    I also recently upgraded with a Sony a7 II mirrorless digital camera & FE
    90mm F2.8 Macro G OSS lens. Switching from a smartphone to an advanced
    camera has a significant learning curve, though, and I have limited time for
    photography, so I can't guarantee a huge quality jump in the a7 photos just
    yet.
