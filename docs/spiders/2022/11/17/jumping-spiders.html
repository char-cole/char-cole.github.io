            <h1>Jumping Spiders: An Introduction</h1>

<p>
    Jumping spiders are some of nature's most fascinating and brilliant
    creatures. They are incredibly charismatic and are widely considered some of
    the cutest "bugs" on Earth. They are so curious, fascinating to watch, and
    safe to handle that they make quite good pets - although they require more
    specialized care than most mammals.
</p>

<p>
    All 6,000+ jumping spider species are members of the family Salticidae, the
    largest family of spiders. Unlike most spiders, which typically have quite
    poor eyesight, jumping spiders actually have excellent vision for their size
    - due in part to their exceptionally large anterior median eyes (front and
    center in their face), one of their most easily recognizable features.
</p>

<p>
    Jumping spiders are also known for their elaborate courtship displays and,
    in some cases, their highly advanced hunting strategies. I have
    unfortunately not yet captured any of these famous behaviors, but I am still
    delighted any time I get to observe one. And, fortunately, they are often
    found in and around my home.
</p>

<p>
    The most common species around me is probably the twin-flagged jumping
    spider <i>Anasaitis canosa</i>. Despite their frequency, I have never
    captured one on my a7, only on my phone camera. The following pictures were
    all taken with a Pixel 5 and no external lens.

        width="350"
        style="margin: 1rem"
    />

    />
    <image
        src="/images/IMG_20220506_173601.jpg"
        alt="possible twin-flagged jumping spider standing on an arm, looking at the camera"
        width="350"
        style="margin: 1rem"
    />
</div>

<p>
    In fact, the last photo is unconfirmed. I didn't get any usable shots from
    another angle to identify it confidently, and I am only going off memory and
    visible coloration when I say I believe it was <i>A. canosa</i>. But banding
    on the legs and the two-tone pedipalps look quite similar to the specimen
    in the first two photos.
