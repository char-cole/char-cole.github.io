            <h1>tier list: Months in the Gregorian Calendar</h1>

<p>
    In this article, the authors examine the value of months in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"
        >Gregorian Calendar</a
    >. There are a few other calendars in widespread use on Earth, but for most
    readers outside China or Iran, this is almost certainly the calendar they
    are most accustomed to (or the only one they are aware of).
</p>

<p>
    What do the authors mean by the "value" of a month? The reader will have
    noticed in their own life that months in the Gregorian Calendar are of
    unequal length. This disparity may appear a harmless quirk at first, but as
    the authors will demonstrate, it feeds into the power structure at the heart
    of Western society. Because much of of modern life is structured around
    fixed monthly payments (that is, payments which do not vary based on the
    length of the month) such as rent, loan repayments, subscription fees, and
    more, the reader will find that a month's "value" is a direct function of
    its length.
</p>

<p>
    First the authors will examine what a month is and how they can be compared.
    Then the authors will classify existing months according to their value,
    specifically from the perspective of an individual whose right to shelter
    and security is contingent upon paying rent each month. Arguably, the
    perspective of a mortgage-paying homeowner is also relevant here. Finally,
    the authors will take a leap of imagination to explore a calendar which
    could be considered more equitable.
</p>

<h2>Defining a Month</h2>

<p>
    A month is a unit of time roughly based on the length of a lunar phase
    cycle, or synodic month. The average length of this cycle is a little over
    29.5 days, so months are typically about 30 days long in most calendars.
</p>

<p>
    A year in the Gregorian Calendar is based on the solar year, or the time it
    takes the Earth to travel its orbit around the sun. This is complicated
    somewhat because solar year is about 365.25 days, but most calendars deal
    only in whole numbers of days. The Gregorian Calendar handles this
    discrepancy by varying the length of a year. A common year is 365 days (less
    than a solar year), and every fourth year is a "leap year" of 366 days.
</p>

<p>
    Bringing these definitions together, we can determine that it is typical to
    have 12 months in a year: <code>365.25 / 29.5 = ~12.38</code>
</p>

<p>
    The reader will note that it is impossible to evenly divide a solar year
    into lunar months. In our calculation, we have a remainder of 0.38 months,
    or over 11 days. Owing to this, the Gregorian Calendar opts for months of
    unequal length - and therefore unequal value.
</p>

<h2>The Value of a Month</h2>

<p>
    The value of any month can be determined by comparing it to the value of an
    average month in a given period which contains that month. Usually, that
    period is one calendar year, meaning from January 1 to December 31. But if
    the reader wishes to evaluate a specific month (e.g. "March 2020"), it may
    be more useful to define a different period - for example, the term of a
    15-month lease. This is because the average length of a month in that period
    may be different from the average of a typical calendar year.
</p>

<p>
    In this review, the authors will calculate the value of months relative to
    three time periods: an ordinary year of 365 days, a leap year of 366 days,
    and a generic year of 365.25 days. Each year is a period from January 1 to
    December 31. The first two calculations may be more relevant to a reader's
    specific circumstances, while the third is most abstract. The authors will
    further discuss the implications below.
</p>

<h3>Calculating an Average</h3>
<p>
    The authors have used the term "average" loosely so far, but find it
    important to note than "average" is a broad term with many interpretations.
    There are three mathematical concepts often used to define "average": mean,
    median, and mode. Of these, the authors will use the mean exclusively in
    this article.
</p>

<p>
    The mean is found by adding up the total number of days of all the months
    (365.25 in a generic year), and dividing by the number of months (12). The
    mean is useful because it defines the length of a month if all months were
    equal in length. In other words, this is the number of days purchased when a
    fixed monthly payment is made. This is the expected value of a month.
</p>

<p>
    Other definitions of average are better at representing a “typical” month,
    because they can represent an actual month which the reader can experience.
    The mean value is not whole number of days, making it impossible for the
    reader to have experienced in the Gregorian Calendar, but the reader is
    invited to find these other methods are not useful in this article:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>The Median</h4>
        <p>
            The median is the value which is in the middle of the set. In a set
            of "1", "2", and "10", the median value is "2". It should be readily
            apparent why this can be deceptive, because it can ignore values
            which are far from the median.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the set of all months in a single year, there are only three
            possible values: 31, 30, and the value of February (either 28 or
            29). February is not the median, as it is the lowest value. It is
            possible that 31 could be the median, if there were many months of
            31 days and few of 30 days. In fact, in the set of all months
            <code class="whitespace-nowrap"
                >28.25 30 30 30 30 30 * 31 31 31 31 31 31</code
            >, the median is between 30 and 31 (denoted with an asterisk). This
            is then calculated as the mean of 30 and 31, which is 30.5 - a
            number that, while not completely wrong, ignores the varying length
            of the year.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>The Mode</h4>
        <p>
            The mode is far simpler to calculate, as it is simply the value
            which occurs most often among the set. In the set of all months in a
            calendar year, this is actually 31, with 6 occurrences. By selecting
            the highest possible value as the average, expectations are skewed
            dramatically. It is no longer possible to have high-value months,
            only average and below-average.
            <br />
            <br />
            Further, the mode month is unrealistic. It is as far from the mean
            synodic month as can be. If every month were 31 days, a year would
            be 372 days long. This definition is completely out of line with the
            solar year.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Thus the authors determine the value of each month by comparing it to the
    value of the mean month in a given year (Fig. 1)
</p>

<table>
    <caption>
        Figure 1, the average month

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Time Period</th>
            <th>Total Days</th>
            <th>Mean Days per Month</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>common year</td>
            <td>365 days</td>
            <td>30.4167 days/month</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>leap year</td>
            <td>366 days</td>
            <td>30.5 days/month</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>mean year</td>
            <td>365.25 days</td>
            <td>30.4375 days/month</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    When comparing a set of months, the reader must consider whether the set
    contains one or more February. As a significant outlier, February has a more
    noticeable effect on the mean than other months. If comparing a set of
    months without a February, the reader may find more accurate results by
    calculating their own mean.
</p>

<p>
    Incidentally, the mean value of a month in a leap year is identical to the
    median at 30 days and 12 hours exactly. But leap years are relatively
    uncommon. The mean common year month is about 30 days and 10 hours, while
    the mean month of a mean or generic year is 30 days, 10 hours, and 30
    minutes.
</p>

<h2>The Tier List</h2>
<p>The tier list is organized as follows, in descending order:</p>

<ul>
    <li>S Tier, exceptional value</li>
    <li>A Tier, highly desirable</li>
    <li>B Tier, satisfying</li>
    <li>C Tier, tolerable</li>
    <li>D Tier, disappointing</li>
    <li>F Tier, unacceptable value</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Tier</h3>
<fieldset role="presentation">
    January - March - May - July - August - October - December
</fieldset>
<p>
    These months offer the absolute best value available. In a leap year, an A
    Tier month such as October offers 12 hours more than the mean. In a common
    year, the advantage is nearly 14 hours. The reader is encouraged to value
    the half-day of liberated time in these months which represent more than
    half the year.
</p>

<h3>D Tier</h3>
<fieldset role="presentation">April - June - September - November</fieldset>
<p>
    One full third of the year is spent in months somewhat shorter than the mean
    month. 10 or 12 hours of time is lost in each of these months, compared to a
    hypothetical month in an evenly-distributed year. However, the individual
    loss is slightly less than what is gained in an A Tier month, and there are
    fewer months in this tier, so between these two tiers a rent-payer comes out
    slightly ahead. However, the reader will find this does not hold for the
    entire year.
</p>

<h3>F Tier</h3>
<fieldset role="presentation">February</fieldset>
<p>
    Regardless of the metric used, February is an objectively poor value. In the
    best case scenario, a leap year, February clocks in exactly 36 hours shorter
    than the mean month. With a fixed monthly rental payment, the wise reader
    will understand they begin paying for the month of March at lunchtime
    <em>the day before</em> the last day of February. The authors strongly
    discourage paying a full month's rent in February.
</p>

<h2>How can the year be made more fair?</h2>
<p>
    There are many possible solutions to the issues outlined above. One is to
    simply prorate rental payments according to the actual number of days in a
    month. This would make the cost of renting in February noticeably less than
    in other months, which may go up or down. But another solution is to create
    an entirely new calendar.
</p>

<p>
    The Gregorian Calendar is by no means the first calendar in the vast
    majority of the world. But although it has evolved from a long lineage of
    calendars, it also has clear flaws, obvious even to children who have not
    yet learned the inertia of tradition. Nor even is it the best calendar yet
    created - the authors are certainly not the first to attempt to create a
    successor to the Gregorian Calendar.
</p>

<p>
    However, to replace a calendar used globally, and in highly intricate and
    interlinked systems such as this web page, would be a truly Herculean task.
    The authors invite the dear reader to consider carefully what other possible
    ways humanity could alleviate the burdens of the powerless.
</p>

<p>
    What follows is a theoretical calendar the authors have crafted as a thought
    experiment. This calendar year is secular, but the authors advocate for an
    allowance of cultural holidays in addition to the secular holidays. This
    calendar favors predictability, stability, and transparency.
</p>

<h3>An Equal Terrestrial Calendar</h3>
<p>
    This calendar retains the basic structure of traditional months: they are
    composed of a number of consecutive days which roughly corresponds to the
    length of a synodic month. Further, as in many calendars, months are
    subdivided into weeks. But in the Gregorian calendar, there is no
    relationship between calendar dates and days of the week - that is, nothing
    says a month must start on a Sunday or end on a Saturday. But in the equal
    terrestrial calendar, each month is composed of <em>whole</em> weeks - the
    first day of each month is also the first day of the week, and the last day
    of each month is always on the last day of the week.
</p>

<p>
    However, the reader will recall that the number of days in a solar year is
    not an even multiple of 12. To solve this, the authors' calendar brings back
    a tradition from ancestors of the Gregorian Calendar: intercalary days.
    These days are not part of any month. In this calendar, they are also not
    part of any week, but are counted independently, and should be holidays. The
    arrangement of these days is discussed later.
</p>

<h3>The Five-Day Week</h3>
<p>
    In this calendar a week is five days long. This allows a simpler and more
    predictable calendar, and allows a significantly more favorable ratio of
    free time. The authors cannot recommend fewer than two days of this week
    being devoted to rest ("weekends"), likely the first and last day of each
    week. This arrangement is a holdover from the Gregorian work week, but
    becomes far more tolerable under the new regime.
</p>

<h3>The Six-Week Month</h3>
<p>
    Each month of the equal terrestrial calendar is exactly six weeks, and thus
    exactly 30 days. Incidentally, this is less than the mean value of a month
    of any Gregorian year. But it is predictable, evenly valued, and easier to
    experience than 12 hours of a hypothetical day. There are also several other
    interesting effects of this month structure.
</p>

<p>
    One effect is that each month is as close as possible to an exact lunar
    cycle (without using partial days). This means that for any two consecutive
    months, the phases of the moon will fall on nearly the same day. Of course,
    significant drift will add up over the course of a year: from one new year
    to the next, the lunar cycle will lag by over one-third. Lunar drift is
    unavoidable in a solar calendar because, as the reader has seen, a solar
    year does not match up to any whole number of synodic months.
</p>

<p>
    However, this structure especially shines in predictability: Calendar dates
    always line up with the same days of the week (Fig. 2). The weeks themselves
    are also numbered - or named, according to cultural values.
</p>

<h3>The Intercalary Days</h3>
<p>
    Twelve months, each being six weeks, makes 360 days. This leaves the astute
    reader lacking 5 days of a full year (6 in a leap year!). While the ancient
    Western calendars were chaotic even compared to the Gregorian calendar,
    adjusted ad-hoc by political motives and wildly inconvenient for modern
    computing, they do offer a tool of tremendous value: intercalary days, which
    belong to no month.
</p>

<p>
    The intercalary days should be treated as holidays, where working would be
    abnormal, as on Rest days. Of course, there may always be some labor which
    can be neither automated nor ceased for an entire day (although the authors
    discourage such operations whenever possible). Shamefully, past
    civilizations often relied upon enslaved people to support their days of
    leisure and rest. Almost as shamefully, modern civilizations rely upon low
    wages and unstable housing to compel constant service for their privileged
    classes. The reader is invited to consider that any labor which is
    absolutely critical to the functions of an economy must be respected as
    such. Those who work such jobs must be allowed more total free time to
    compensate for the demands placed on their schedules.
</p>

<p>
    While the reader may be tempted to collect all intercalary holidays in a
    single pseudo-week at the beginning or the end of the year, the authors
    believe this all-or-nothing approach has a less stable effect on the
    emotions and health of humans.
</p>

<p>
    Instead these holidays are spaced throughout the year. Too evenly spaced and
    they are reduced to a single day every other month at best. Rather, these
    holidays are most wisely arranged in two groups: 3 days before the beginning
    of January, and 2 days between June and July. Every fourth year, this
    mid-year break becomes 3 days as well. The authors believe it is important
    to begin the year on a universal holiday; understanding that people are
    encouraged to stay up to an unhealthy time and drink alcohol while observing
    the changing of the year, the authors advise rest.
</p>

<p>
    The authors have also slightly adjusted the timing of the beginning of the
    year. Appreciating the symbolism of the year ending at the beginning of
    winter (in the northern hemisphere), the final day of the year is on the
    median day of the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. This
    usually occurs on December 21 in the Gregorian calendar. This relatively
    small change would also help to ease any hypothetical transition in society.
</p>

<p>
    The obvious question is raised: Who pays for housing on a day that belongs
    to no month, a day that almost no one will work? To the authors, the answers
    is just as obvious: it is the ones who build wealth without working anyway.
    Should the global economic system maintain the right of individuals to
    directly profit from the labor of others by owning and renting out housing,
    it would be unthinkable to ask concessions of those in the more vulnerable
    position. In the case of public housing, the authors see no reason not to
    extend the same argument: the party of greater means and wealth should bear
    the burden, exentding housing contracts without extra cost to the renters.

    With this authors conclude their experiment: A new year dawns with a new
    calendar. On the first day after the winter solstice, a three-day
    celebration brings comfort and free time to all before beginning six weeks
    of January. Days grow lighter and longer for six regular months, until the
    summer solstice is celebrated on a weekend and for two or three more days of
    rest. Over the next six months, the days grow shorter and darker until the
    year ends with the final weekend of December and a new cycle. Months are
    characterized by their weather, their astronomical events, their individual
    holidays - not their arbitrary length. And no one pays rent for 36 hours of
    their life unlived.
