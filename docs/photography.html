    ðŸš§ Heads up! This is a new project for me, and I'm still in the process of
    organizing hundreds of new and archived photos into blog posts with context.
    There may not be much content yet, but there is much to come!
</p>

<p>
    This is my photography blog, where I share and describe some of my favorite
    photos. Almost all of my photography is "macro", meaning high-magnification
    photos of very small things.
</p>

<p>
    The most common subject of my blog is spiders. Some posts will be be about
    insects, gastropods, or microbes. Actually, hymenoptera (wasps, ants, and
    bees) and coleoptera (beetles) are some of my favorite creatures. But
    spiders make a better hobby for several reasons: they are common in wide
    variety, they are badly misunderstood by the public, and identification
    resources are much more widely available.

    Most of my photos were taken on a Pixel 3 or Pixel 5. Some of those were
    additionally taken through a 10x magnification hand lens - these are
    typically distinguishable by a very shallow focus (where most of the subject
    will be out of focus and the background will have pronounced

    lens. While the power of the a7 is immediately apparent to me and I've taken
    many photographs impossible for a smartphone, the learning curve is
    significant. No quality guarantees during the learning period.
