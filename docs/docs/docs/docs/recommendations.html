        <b>Bloodborne</b> (From Software - Playstation 4). Certainly a
        challenging game and not for the squeamish, this game will not appeal to
        all. It is gory, unsettling, and at times frustrating. But the
        atmosphere and story are virtually unparalleled. The combat is
        exquisite, as its focus on a narrower set of transforming weapons, quick
        movement, and aggressive tactics allows it to shine in a way few other
        Souls-like games can capture. (Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice is an honorable
        mention for similar reasons as everything stated above.) If one is
        willing to dedicate the time and focus to really learning the combat,
        they will find <i>Bloodborne</i> an unforgettable experience and should
        joyously complete it at least 3 times (to see all the endings).

        <b>Rimworld</b> (Ludeon Studios, PC). This game earns its place due to
        the slightly lowered complexity compared to its legendary inspiration,
        <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>. While the latter is the absolute king of
        simulation and management games, it is also exceedingly difficult to
        enter due to its UI, and I personally have never taken the time to
        really get into it for more than a few hours. <i>Rimworld</i> took a
        much more focused approach and created a relatively clean, friendly UI,
        drawing the player in to a world that is anything but clean and
        friendly. Guiding emotional colonists through survival on a hostile,
        backwater planet in the distant future should sounds attractive or the
        player may not stick to this game.However, with customizable difficulty
        and thousands of excellent mods, this can't truly be called a
        "difficult" game. One can simply disable threats they don't like, tune
        down their frequency, or otherwise make this the game they really enjoy
        - although like many I do play it in a way that challenges me, so I
        always have to learn to manage new threats.
