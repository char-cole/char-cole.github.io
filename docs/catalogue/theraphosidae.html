<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Tarantulas are large, robust spiders, usually quite hairy. Some other spiders of closely related families are sometimes called “tarantula” as well, however. Tarantulas are members of the “sensing web weaver” guild, which hide in their burrow lined with silk and detect prey approaching or entering by vibrations in their webs. Tarantulas are unique because almost all new-world species have stinging bristles called urticating hairs, a defense mechanism shared with many plants and caterpillars. On tarantulas, these are found in a large patch, often visible, on the dorsal opisthosoma - but they are usually only mildly irritating to humans. Theraphosidae are also considered one of the more difficult families to identify.</p>
