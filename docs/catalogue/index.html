            <h1>Photography Catalogue</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to my photography catalogue, where I record encounters with many of
    my favorite creatures. Typically, these are invertebrate animals such as
    insects and spiders.

    ðŸ“… This section of the site currently updated on a weekly basis as I comb
    through my growing backlog of photos. One or more specimens will be
    described each weekend.
    <br />
    <br />
    ðŸŽ² There is no order to my identification and documentation process, and new
    specimens aren't prioritized. There will not be spiders every week.
    <br />
    <br />
    ðŸ—ƒ Many older specimens may never be uploaded as I can't identify them or
    don't have good enough photos - eventually, I may create a section for
    those. Perhaps the reader can help identify some of them!

<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>

<h3 id="arachnida"><a href="arachnida">Class Arachnida</a> (arachnids)</h3>
<p>
    Arachnids are small creatures (from microscopic to hand-sized) with eight
    legs, usually six or eight eyes, no wings, and an exoskeleton rather than
    internal bones.
</p>
<p>
    Arachnids are my most common subject, although they are almost completely
    dominated by order Araneae: spiders. There are five other orders of
    arachnids, but these are largely less diverse, less prolific, and more
    dangerous to humans than spiders. Scorpions and even ticks are among these.
</p>
<p>
    My motivation for photographing arachnids is quite personal, and the
    arachnid catalogue is the primary function of this web site. I was terribly
    arachnophobic when I was younger, and I couldn't bear to look at photographs
    of spiders. After college I determined to reduce my anxiety by exposing
    myself to images of spiders because I badly wanted to spend more time in
    natural places, which are ususally great spider habitats. This worked well
    enough that I could sleep with an orb weaver in the corner of the room near
    my head, understanding that the spider wanted absolutely nothing from me and
    didn't even want to move. Over time my understanding has turned into
    respect, fascination, and adoration of spiders and other arachnids except
    ticks. When I began photographing then as a record of my encounters (without
    knowing how to identify them), I began to really enjoy seeing the amazing
    adaptive features of these animals and wanted to know them better.
</p>

<h3 id="insecta"><a href="insecta">Class Insecta</a> (insects)</h3>
<p>
    Insects are small creatures (from microscopic to hand-sized) with six legs,
    ususally two or four wings, and an exoskeleton rather than internal bones.
</p>
<p>
    Although I photograph many insects, they can be very difficult to identify.
    Because of that, this section is updated far less than arachnida.
</p>
<p>
    Currently there are 4 entries, each in a different family. Insect families
    are extraordinarily diverse; each has numerous unique traits and behaviors.
</p>
<p>
    Before I developed such a deep interest in spiders, I was photographing
    insects. The incredible diversity among insects means it is easy to come
    across one or another type to fall in love with. Some of my favorite animals
    are hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), in particular the complex
    structures of eusocial species. However in my photo catalogue I focus on
    more unusual and visually compelling insects.
</p>

<h3 id="microbes"><a href="microbes">misc. microbes</a></h3>
<p>
    "Microbe" is a general terms for any living being too small to see without a
    microscope. This includes members of all kingdoms and domains of life, such
    as algae, animals, plants, fungus, and more.
</p>
<p>
    Resources for microbe identification are not very easy for laypersons to
    access, and identification is especially difficult without more specialized
    equipment. For this and other technical reasons, this section receives the
    fewest updates.
</p>
<p>Currently two phyla of animals are represented: Nematodes and Rotifers.</p>

    - these are typically distinguishable by a very shallow focus (where most of
    the subject will be out of focus and the background will have pronounced

    has a 10x eyepiece lens and four objective lenses at 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x.
    The total magnification of the subject is thus from 40x to 1000x. However,
    all photos taken through my microscope are taken with my Pixel 5 and further
    magnified by its lens.

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>
    <b>Macro photography</b> is the practice of photographing very small
    organisms or objects with very high magnification so the subject appears
    greater than life size. Other terms for this include
    <b>microphotography</b> (but this can also mean the practice of shrinking
    physical photographs to tiny sizes), <b>photomacrography</b>, or
    <b>macrography</b>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Microscopy</b> is the practice of using a microscope. Although taking
    photos through a microscope is a form of macro photography, it also has a
    specific name: <b>photomicrography</b>.
