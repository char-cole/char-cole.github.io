<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Salticids have a unique and recognizable form. With a large pair of anterior
median (central, forward-facing) eyes, most jumping spider species are
considered exceptionally cute, even by people uncomfortable with spiders. They
can also be distinguished by their behavior: they are the only spiders that
regularly jump. Their movement can range from slow, mechanical walking to a
series of short hops to longer jumps across gaps.</p>

<p>In addition, they are highly active and curious. If approached gently, they may
take the time to look a human in the eye and try to observe it back. (They do
not necessarily understand they are looking at a large eye, though.) They can
still be skittish if startled or threatened, but otherwise they are almost
always on the move, examining their surroundings. As active hunters, they
continually seek prey, mates, or shelter.</p>

<p>Jumping spiders have exceptional vision. Even though all spiders have six or
eight eyes, most actually have very poor vision; Salticidae on the other hand
has vision better than many creatures orders of magnitude larger.</p>

<p>Further, salticids display remarkable intelligence in their hunting behaviors.
Some have even been observed planning approach routes that break line of sight,
something normally not expected of a creature with such a small brain.</p>

<p>The Salticidae family is also the largest of all spider families. Jumping
spiders are extraordinarily successful and visually diverse. They are beloved
for their rich coloration and the delightfully complex courtship behavior of
many species.</p>
