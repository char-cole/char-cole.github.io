<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Assassin bugs are named for their long proboscis which they use
to impale other animals from ambush.</p>

<p>There are many species of assassin bugs, and it’s difficult for a layperson to
identify them confidently because they change shape and color in different life
stages (this is true of many insect groups). For a long time, I was unsure if I
was seeing multiple species of assassin bugs, but I was fortunate in spring 2022
to get shots of groups of milkweed assassin bugs in a variety of stages of
growth.</p>

<p>By comparing specimens in the imago (adult) stage and at different ages in the nymph
stage side-by-side, it becomes apparent that these are all the same species.
Notice the black wings beginning to form on some of the older nymphs. As it
turns out, most of the assassin bugs I have seen are all various morphs of the
milkweed assassin bug, <em>Zelus longpipes</em> Linnaeus. These creatures roughly
triple in size of the course of their nymphal stage.</p>
