# welcome

## about me

I am Charles Cole (they/them), and usually a software engineer and photographer living in Texas, where I've
spent most of my life. I studied Classical Greek at Southwestern University due
to a longstanding love of history and linguistics. However, I found my interests
wandering toward the end of undergrad. I studied sustainable agriculture and
permaculture for a time. Eventually I found my way to Austin Coding Academy,
where I studied web design & development.

## work history

As a software engineer, I've primarily done front-end work in JavaScript and
TypeScript. I enjoy creating something visual and interactive. After completing
Austin Coding Academy's full-stack web development course, I was hired to make
them a new marketing site. I then worked at data.world as a contract software
engineer working on their UI. after the end of this contract, I began work at
eHealthInsurance. In this role I've had opportunities to work on a NodeJS server
as well as UI projects in a variety of frameworks and languages.

## photography

One of my greatest joys is to create a new perspective and see the world in an
atypical way. Cameras and other optical lenses are excellent tools for doing so. In my spare time, or whenever a good opportunity arises, I can often be found practicing so-called "macro" photography (more accurately microphotography), as well as microscopy/photomicrography. Arthropods are a particular interest due to their alien body structures and delicate features, and I spend many hours "spidering" (tracking down and identifying spiders).

Spidering blog is under construction.

## other interests

### games

I am an avid and critical player of board and video games, which is what originally led me to software engineering. With my close friends, I have spent hundreds of hours discussing the qualities of various game we have played, exploring alternate mechanics or rule alterations, and designing our own games.

### reading

I am also a heavy reader, typically of fantasy and science-fiction. I find some of my most profound understandings have come from reading fiction - but mostly it is just thrilling and spurs creativity.

### science & history

I maintain strong interest in history and science despite not pursuing formal studies in them (yet). I consume many books, articles, videos, and documentaries - particularly on ancient history, physics, marine biology and paleontology. I also spend time learning about spiders, insect, and microorganisms due to my interest in cataloguing these creatures, often from online resources.
