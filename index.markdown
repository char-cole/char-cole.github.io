# welcome

## about me

I am Charles Cole (they/them), currently a software engineer and photographer
living in Texas, where I've spent most of my life. I studied Classical Greek at
Southwestern University due to a longstanding love of history and linguistics.
However, I found my interests wandering toward the end of undergrad. I studied
sustainable agriculture and permaculture for a time. Eventually I found my way
to Austin Coding Academy, where I studied web design & development.

## work history

As a software engineer, I've primarily done front-end work in JavaScript and
TypeScript. I enjoy creating something visual and interactive. After completing
Austin Coding Academy's full-stack web development course, I was hired to make
them a new marketing site. I then worked at data.world as a contract software
engineer working on their UI. After the end of this contract, I began work at
eHealthInsurance. In this role I've had opportunities to work on a NodeJS server
as well as UI projects in a variety of frameworks and languages.

## photography

One of my greatest joys is to create a new perspective and see the world in an
atypical way. Cameras and other optical lenses are excellent tools for doing so.
In my spare time, or whenever a good opportunity arises, I can often be found
practicing so-called "macro" photography (more accurately microphotography), as
well as microscopy/photomicrography. Arthropods are a particular interest due to
their alien body structures and delicate features, and I spend many hours
"spidering" (tracking down and identifying spiders).

## other interests

### insect collecting

Of course it's great to find an insect in the wild, moving slow enough (or not at all) to be photographed. But to have the insect on hand, viewable from any angle, through many lenses, and perhaps even mounted in a beautiful display, is another joy entirely. I practice no-kill collection only, which limits my options considerably to those rare insects which have died recently, nonviolently, and near my current location. Even so, my collection continues to grow over the years. Creating displays is a different art and one I have much to learn about from the masters.

### gardening

Plants are fascinating in their own right, and I always keep some in and around
my home. I like to see how they grow and respond to their environmental
conditions. But even better, of course, is that they provide habitat for the
arthropods I love so much. With plants, I can bring favorites such as assassin
bugs and orchard orb weavers to my door. Having lived in a variety of homes, I
find this most effective in an apartment, however. The limitation of not having
a yard or nearby wild space makes my well kept plants a more attractive option
for local bugs. Living with a yard is thus doubly frustrating to me - not only
is it a wasteful prank upon the resident, it provides abundant hiding places for
my bugs as I allow it become overgrown.

### reading

I read a lot of fiction (books and short stories) and nonfiction (articles, blogs, and sometimes books). At any given time I am likely reading or waiting on a science fiction or fantasy novel. Even in lackluster fiction, there is usually insight to be gleaned or knowledge to be uncovered – and a story to carry it forward. For nonfiction, I average about one or two articles or blog posts per day, but I often don’t finish books. One of the more difficult, but valuable, lessons I’ve learned as a reader is when to simply be done with a book I’m no longer enjoying or learning from.

Without explanation, some of my top recommendations for fiction are:
- _Blindsight_ or _Starfish_, by Peter Watts (who also runs a pretty good blog at rifters.org)
- _The Children of Húrin_, by Tolkien (who wrote some other books you may be more familiar with)
- anything in the _Hainish Cycle_, by Ursula K. Leguin (including her most famous work, _The Left Hand of Darkness_)
- _Lilith’s Brood_, by Octavia Butler

### games

I am also an avid and critical player of all manner of games (board, video,
word, etc.), which is what originally led me to programming. A game is just an
algorithm, after all. With my close friends, I have spent hundreds of hours
discussing the qualities of various game we have played, exploring alternate
mechanics or rule alterations, and designing our own games.

Some of my favorite games are:
- _Bloodborne_ (PS4) - From Software. A high-intensity action game steeped in unspeakable horror. Not for the faint of heart, and quite challenging. The only game I've ever gone for 100% completion (and still keep playing today).
- _Forbidden Island_ (board game) - Matt Leacock. While there are sequels and probably other similar games, this game is something of a classic and an excellent cooperative board game. Many people are only familiar with competitive (and often deception-based) board games which can be frustrating or even unfun; I suggest _Forbidden Island_ or a game like it for a change of pace.
- _Cities: Skylines_ (PC) - Colossal Order. Many of us adored SimCity growing up and were left disappointed by the downfall of the series. This game took up that mantle and ran with it, becoming something far more powerful, beautiful, and creative. While not the easiest game to get into, _Cities: Skylines_ allows tremendous freedom and endless lessons on why the best traffic management is public transit.

I could (and will!) write for dozens of hours about games I've loved over the past few decades. Watch for not-at-all-timely game review blog posts in the future.

### worldbuilding

Worldbuilding is a type of creative writing which allows the exploration of
almost unlimited topics in the service of creating a cohesive, believable
setting (for stories or games, usually). I began by creating a setting for some
of my earliest Dungeons & Dragons games in high school. But I always preferred
the worldbuilding to the plot; the mechanics of playing D&D have always been an
order of magnitude more clear than the mechanics of writing for it. So I never
became a very good Dungeon Master or adventure writer. And while I hardly play
tabletop roleplaying games anymore, I still dabble in writing for them. It gives
me an excuse to pursue many other interests: sociology, history, materials
science, political science, biology, geography, economics, astronomy, religion,
linguistics, and more.
