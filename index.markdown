## about me

I am Charles Cole (they/them). I am currently a professional software engineer
and amateur photographer living in Texas. I created this web site with
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener">Jekyll</a>. It is built around a custom
<a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid</a> catalogue & photo gallery. The
source code is available on
<a href="https://github.com/char-cole/char-cole.github.io">GitHub</a>.

This web site contains no tracking or JavaScript at all, but it does contain
links to other web sites which may track visitors.

## engineering

I attended Austin Coding Academy in 2018 and studied web design and full-stack
JavaScript development.

After graduating I became an intern at Austin Coding Academy and built a
<a href="https://austincodingacademy.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >new marketing web site</a>. This was made using Jekyll and amp-script.

I then took a contract position at <a
        href="https://data.world"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >data.world</a
    > and learned TypeScript, Jest, and Cypress. There I learned to develop &
ship new features in a complex app to production.

I have been at <a
        href="https://ehealth.com"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >ehealth</a
    > since late 2019. I've worked on a variety of projects in React, Vue, Node,
and <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanilla JS</a>. I have migrated several
projects to modern technology, including creating a new marketing site and blog
in Gatsby at <a
        href="ehealthinsurance.com/medicare/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >ehealthinsurance.com/medicare/</a> and rebuilding the online e-commerce
platform at <a
        href="ehealthmedicareplans.com/v2"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >ehealthmedicareplans.com/v2</a>.

## photography

One of my greatest joys is to create a new perspective and see the world in an
atypical way. Cameras and other optical lenses are excellent tools for doing so.
In my spare time, or whenever a good opportunity arises, I can often be found
examining very small creatures and objects through a magnifying glass, a hand
lens, a phone camera, a digital camera, a microscope, or some combination of the
aforementioned.

Although my primary motivation is to simply enjoy superhuman abilities of
perception, I also like to document and share the amazing and alien things one
is able to see with optical tools. In particular, I am an avid practitioner of
"spidering", the act of seeking out and identifying spiders. But I also
photograph many non-spider arthropods as well as microorganisms of all domains
of life.

## other interests

### insect collecting

Of course it's great to find an insect in the wild, moving slow enough (or not
at all) to be photographed. But to have the insect on hand, viewable from any
angle, through many lenses, and perhaps even mounted in a beautiful display, is
another joy entirely. I practice no-kill collection only, which limits my
options considerably to those rare insects which have died recently,
nonviolently, and near my current location. Even so, my collection continues to
grow over the years.

### gardening

I always keep some plants in and around my home. I like to see how they grow and
respond to their environmental conditions. But even better, of course, is that
they provide habitat for other creatures. With plants, I can bring favorites
such as assassin bugs and orchard orb weavers to my door.

Having lived in a variety of homes, I find plants are most effective as an
arthropod habitat in an apartment. The limitation of not having a yard or nearby
wild space makes well loved plants a more attractive option for local bugs.
Living with a yard is thus doubly frustrating to me - not only is it a wasteful
prank upon the resident, it provides abundant hiding places for my bugs as I
allow it become overgrown. However, keeping plants at a freestanding home means
frogs may shelter in them, so there is something to enjoy wherever you are.

### reading

I read a lot of fiction (books and short stories) and nonfiction (articles,
blogs, and sometimes books). I primarily enjoy science fiction and fantasy, in
that order.

A few of my top recommendations in fiction are:

-   _Blindsight_ or _Starfish_, by Peter Watts (who also runs a pretty good blog
    at rifters.org)
-   _The Children of Húrin_, by Tolkien (who wrote other books you may be more
    familiar with)
-   Ursula K. Leguin's series _The Hainish Cycle_ (including her most famous
    work, _The Left Hand of Darkness_)
-   _Lilith’s Brood_, by Octavia Butler, which might be considered an optimistic
    future for humanity

### games

I am also an avid and critical player of all manner of games (board, video,
word, etc.), which is what originally led me to programming - a game is defined
by its rules, which are just an algorithm. I've spent nearly as many hours
analyzing, discussing, and crafting games as I have playing them.

Some of my favorite games are:

-   _Bloodborne_ (PS4) - From Software. A high-intensity action game steeped in
    unspeakable horror. Extremely violent and fairly difficult. However, it is
    beautiful and very fun; this is one of the few games I've reached 100%
    completion in, and I still continue to play today.
-   _Forbidden Island_ (board game) - Matt Leacock. While there are sequels and
    probably other similar games, this game is something of a classic and an
    excellent cooperative board game. Many people are only familiar with
    competitive (and often deception-based) board games which can be frustrating
    or even unfun; I suggest _Forbidden Island_ or a game like it for a change
    of pace.
-   _Cities: Skylines_ (PC) - Colossal Order. Many of us adored SimCity growing
    up and were left disappointed by the downfall of the series. This game
    however has more than filled that niche, becoming something far more
    powerful, beautiful, and creative. While not the easiest game to get into,
    _Cities: Skylines_ allows tremendous freedom, a strong modding community,
    and endless lessons on why the best traffic management is public transit.

### worldbuilding

Worldbuilding is a type of creative writing which allows the exploration of
almost unlimited topics in the service of creating a cohesive, believable
setting (for stories or games, usually). I began by creating a setting for some
of my earliest Dungeons & Dragons games in high school. But I always preferred
the worldbuilding to the plot writing. And while I hardly play tabletop
roleplaying games anymore, I still dabble in building settings for them. It
gives me an excuse to pursue many other interests: sociology, history, materials
science, political science, biology, geography, economics, astronomy, religion,
linguistics, and more.
