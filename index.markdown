# welcome

## about me

I am Charles Cole (they/them). I am currently a professional software engineer
and amateur photographer living in Texas. In college, I studied Classical Greek
at Southwestern University, but pursued other interests after graduation. For a
couple years I studied sustainable agriculture and permaculture. Eventually I
returned to Texas and later decided to pursue a career in programming; I studied
web design & development at Austin Coding Academy.

## work history

After completing Austin Coding Academy's full-stack web development course, I
was hired to create their <a href="https://austincodingacademy.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >new marketing site</a> (some of what I created is still there). I then
worked at <a
        href="https://data.world"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >data.world</a
    > on contract, developing new features and updates in
their front end with TypeScript. Since then I have worked at eHealth, where I have built & maintained several sites, most notably <a
        href="https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/medicare/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/medicare/</a
    > (note: this site makes heavy use 3rd-party tracking).

## photography

One of my greatest joys is to create a new perspective and see the world in an
atypical way. Cameras and other optical lenses are excellent tools for doing so.
In my spare time, or whenever a good opportunity arises, I can often be found examining very small creatures and objects through a magnifying glass, a hand lens, a phone camera, a digital camera, a microscope, or some combination of the aforementioned.

Although my primary motivation is to simply enjoy superhuman abilities of perception, I also like to document and share the amazing and alien things one is able to see with optical tools. In particular, I am an avid practitioner of "spidering", the act of seeking out and identifying spiders. But I also photograph many non-spider arthropods as well as microorganisms of all domains of life.

## other interests

### insect collecting

Of course it's great to find an insect in the wild, moving slow enough (or not
at all) to be photographed. But to have the insect on hand, viewable from any
angle, through many lenses, and perhaps even mounted in a beautiful display, is
another joy entirely. I practice no-kill collection only, which limits my
options considerably to those rare insects which have died recently,
nonviolently, and near my current location. Even so, my collection continues to
grow over the years. Creating displays is a different art and one I have much to
learn about from the masters.

### gardening

Plants are fascinating in their own right, and I always keep some in and around
my home. I like to see how they grow and respond to their environmental
conditions. But even better, of course, is that they provide habitat for the
arthropods I love so much. With plants, I can bring favorites such as assassin
bugs and orchard orb weavers to my door. Having lived in a variety of homes, I
find this most effective in an apartment, however. The limitation of not having
a yard or nearby wild space makes my well kept plants a more attractive option
for local bugs. Living with a yard is thus doubly frustrating to me - not only
is it a wasteful prank upon the resident, it provides abundant hiding places for
my bugs as I allow it become overgrown.

### reading

I read a lot of fiction (books and short stories) and nonfiction (articles,
blogs, and sometimes books). At any given time I am likely reading or waiting on
a science fiction or fantasy novel. Even in lackluster fiction, there is usually
insight to be gleaned or knowledge to be uncovered – and a story to carry it
forward. For nonfiction, I average about one or two articles or blog posts per
day, but I often don’t finish books. One of the more difficult, but valuable,
lessons I’ve learned as a reader is when to simply be done with a book I’m no
longer enjoying or learning from.

Without explanation, some of my top recommendations for fiction are:

-   _Blindsight_ or _Starfish_, by Peter Watts (who also runs a pretty good blog
    at rifters.org)
-   _The Children of Húrin_, by Tolkien (who wrote some other books you may be
    more familiar with)
-   anything in the _Hainish Cycle_, by Ursula K. Leguin (including her most
    famous work, _The Left Hand of Darkness_)
-   _Lilith’s Brood_, by Octavia Butler

### games

I am also an avid and critical player of all manner of games (board, video,
word, etc.), which is what originally led me to programming. A game is just an
algorithm, after all. With my close friends, I have spent hundreds of hours
discussing the qualities of various game we have played, exploring alternate
mechanics or rule alterations, and designing our own games.

Some of my favorite games are:

-   _Bloodborne_ (PS4) - From Software. A high-intensity action game steeped in
    unspeakable horror. Not for the faint of heart, and quite challenging. The
    only game I've ever gone for 100% completion (and still keep playing today).
-   _Forbidden Island_ (board game) - Matt Leacock. While there are sequels and
    probably other similar games, this game is something of a classic and an
    excellent cooperative board game. Many people are only familiar with
    competitive (and often deception-based) board games which can be frustrating
    or even unfun; I suggest _Forbidden Island_ or a game like it for a change
    of pace.
-   _Cities: Skylines_ (PC) - Colossal Order. Many of us adored SimCity growing
    up and were left disappointed by the downfall of the series. This game took
    up that mantle and ran with it, becoming something far more powerful,
    beautiful, and creative. While not the easiest game to get into, _Cities:
    Skylines_ allows tremendous freedom and endless lessons on why the best
    traffic management is public transit.

I could (and will!) write for dozens of hours about games I've loved over the
past few decades. Watch for not-at-all-timely game review blog posts in the
future.

### worldbuilding

Worldbuilding is a type of creative writing which allows the exploration of
almost unlimited topics in the service of creating a cohesive, believable
setting (for stories or games, usually). I began by creating a setting for some
of my earliest Dungeons & Dragons games in high school. But I always preferred
the worldbuilding to the plot; the mechanics of playing D&D have always been an
order of magnitude more clear than the mechanics of writing for it. So I never
became a very good Dungeon Master or adventure writer. And while I hardly play
tabletop roleplaying games anymore, I still dabble in writing for them. It gives
me an excuse to pursue many other interests: sociology, history, materials
science, political science, biology, geography, economics, astronomy, religion,
linguistics, and more.
