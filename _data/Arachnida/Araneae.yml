      - name: <i>Anasaitas canosa</i>
        id: a-canosa
        imgPrefix: sac
        common: Twin Flagged Jumping Spider
        description: A small jumping spider with black, white, and grey coloration. Its name is a reference to mirrored pairs of white spots found on its pedipalps and dorsal prosoma, making this spider easily identifiable. First legs are mostly black; other legs have more pronounced splotches or banding of grey and black. This species has a wider stance than many other jumping spiders
        notes: A very common jumping spider in central Texas, <i>Anasaitas canosa</i> is found from Mexico to the American Southeast.

      - name: <i>Phidippus clarus</i>
        id: p-clarus
        imgPrefix: spc
        common: Brilliant Jumping Spider
        description: This species is brightly colored, but males and females have very different colorations. Males are mostly black, with vivid blue chelicerae, red opisthosoma markings, and white leg bands. Female coloration is a combination of orange, brown, and tan. Both morphs are covered in short hairs giving a fuzzy appearance.
        captions:
        - Bright and fuzzy <i>Phidippus clarus</i> jumping spider found on a watering can.
        - The same <i>P. clarus</i> seen from the front, with silk dragline visible in the background.

      - name: <i>Habronattus coecatus</i>
        id: h-coecatus
        imgPrefix: shc
        description: Though males of genus Habronattus are quite colorful and are called "paradise spiders", females are largely grey and indistinct. <i>H. coecatus</i> happens to have the plainest females commonly found in my area, making the images below a likely but uncertain identification.
        captions:
        - Dull female jumping spider, likely <i>Habronattus coecatus</i>, on a green leaf.
        - Front-facing shot of the same <i>Habronattus spp.</i>
      - name: <i>Hentzia palmarum</i>
        id: h-palmarum
        common: Common Hentz Jumper
        imgPrefix: shp
        description: Highly sexually dimorphic. Males have long, dark first legs and broad white bands around their brown bodies, as well as large pedipalps white white bands. Females are mostly a pale tan color with less distinct first legs.
        captions:

  - name: corinnidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Castianeira descripta</i>
        id: c-descripta
        imgPrefix: ccd
        common: Red-spotted Ant Mimic
        description: This spider is black, nearly hairless, and has a large red mark over most of its opisthosoma, causing it to potentially be misidentified as a black widow. It will often be seen with its first legs extended in front of it like antennae.
        notes: Known to run on six legs, using its front pair as antennae similar to ants, this species is sometimes said to use that behavior to trick ants into letting it get close enough to prey on them. However, I will note that I have never seen a reference for this factoid and it seems dubious, given that the spider is much larger than almost any ants in central Texas and not colored or shaped like them. Typical of Corinnidae, this species is a fast runner.
        captions:
        - <i>Castianeira descripta</i> seen running on an urban street, attempting to hide from me under a very small plant stem.
        - The same <i>C. descripta</i>, with large red opisthosoma marking clearly visible, sheltering beside a piece of bark.
      - name: <i>Falconina gracilis</i>
        id: f-gracilis
        imgPrefix: cfg
        description: The prosoma is smooth and dark-brown to black. The opisthosoma can be the same color or paler brown, and has distinct, mirrored pale spots. The legs are more thin and brown.
        notes: Only found in southern California and near the gulf coast, this species has no common name.
        captions:
        - An adult <i>Falconina gracilis</i> seen running along the ground at night. It moved very quickly, and periodically stopped and appeared to plunge its chelicerae down into the soil.

  - name: oxyopidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Peucetia viridans</i>
        id: p-viridans
        imgPrefix: opv
        common: Green Lynx Spider
        description: Hard to mistake, this spider is vivid green, blending in effectively with certain leaves (and standing out sorely from duller plants). Though there is one jumping spider with similar shape and coloration, <i>P. viridans</i> has long leg spines visible to the naked eye and sometimes white, yellow, pink, or red chevrons marking its opisthosoma. As with all Oxyopidae, the eight eyes are small and arranged somewhat hexagonally, but <i>P. viridans</i> bears them in a tight grouping around a dark spot at the top of its prosoma.
        captions:
        - <i>Peucetia viridans</i> blending in well with sweet potato leaves. Despite missing two legs, it has captured a house fly as prey.
        - The same specimen, still missing two legs, having captured a fruit fly the next day.
        - A vivid <i>P. viridans</i> with barely visible chevron markings, resting in excellent camouflage on a basil leaf.
        - An extraordinarily large and colorful specimen (likely female based on size), holding a first tarsus to its chelicerae.
        - Another shot of the same specimen, with brightly colored and distinct chevrons visible.

  - name: theraphosidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Aphonopelma anax</i>
        id: a-anax
        imgPrefix: taa
        common: Texas Tan Tarantula
        description: Confusingly named, this spider is best identified by contrasting its very dark legs with its tan body. The Texas Brown Tarantula, on the other hand, is more evenly brown all over. However, Rose[1] seems to describe both as the same species with high variation.
        notes: Females of this genus can live at least 4 decades and rarely leave their dens; males wander in spring and fall looking for mates, and only survive a couple years at maturity.
        captions:
        - A poor picture taken in surprise, at a distance, of a (probably male) <i>Aphonopelma spp.</i> out wandering Davis Mountains State Park in September.

    species:
      - name: <i>Rabidosa rabida</i>
        id: r-rabida
        imgPrefix: lrr
        common: Rabid Wolf Spider
        description: Primarily tan with brown marking, this species has long legs and a flat posture. Although many wolf spiders look similar to the untrained eye, there are key details which make this species unmistakable. If seen from the front, narrow brown vertical stripes extend the length of the center of its chelicerae. If seen from above, the median (central) dark band extends all the way down the opisthosoma to the spinnerets and contains faint tan chevrons toward the latter end.
        notes: Despite its absurdly fearsome name, this spider is not especially aggressive or dangerous in any way. Nor, in fact, is it rare. In my personal experience it is by far the most common spider in urban and suburban central Texas. Take a headlamp into any yard or open area at night and see the grass light up; each point is almost certainly a set of <i>Rabidosa rabida</i> eyes.
        captions:
        - <i>Rabidosa rabida</i> seen at night on a concrete sidewalk. Note the distinctive chevrons on the median dark band. The small size of the opisthosoma indicates a male; the dark front legs indicate a mature male.
        - This Rabid Wolf Spider was disturbed by the grass being cut and retreated up onto the side of an urban house. This specimen clearly displays another identifying feature, a "feathered" pattern in the lateral dark bands of the opisthosoma. The large opisthosoma indicates a female.
        - Though not easily determined from the photo, this was the largest <i>R. rabida</i> I have ever seen; it was spotted in a suburban garden at night in a yard full of dozens of other specimens. Note the high contrast between the pale chelicerae and the dark stripes running down them. As a mature specimen, this must be female because its legs are all the same color.
        - A roughly lit specimen seen by a paved urban nature trail at night. In addition to the visible chelicerae stripes and the lateral band "feathering", the mature male's dark first legs are unique to this species.

      - name: <i>Latrodectus geometricus</i>
        id: l-geometricus
        imgPrefix: tlg
        common: Brown Widow Spider
        description: This spider is reported to have highly variable coloration, but is typically yellow-brown or tan. The signature hourglass can range from yellow to red. Typical of a widow spider, this species is hairless and has long, delicate legs.
        notes: Native to Africa, this species has been introduced to Europe and North America by humans. This species may have painful venom, but its bite is not as dangerous as that of a black widow. Some research indicates that brown widows are displacing native western black widows in southern California, to the possible benefit of humans (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1603/ME11285">Journal of Medical Entomology</a>).
        captions:
        - Probable <i>Latrodectus geometricus</i> spotted in a characteristic "tangle web" over a small hollow in the transition zone between the Mojave & Colorado deserts of southern California.
        - Pedipalps focused - This specimen appears to have large, prominent pedipalps, indicating it a mature male.
        - Hourglass focused - Note the signature hourglass shape on the ventral opisthosoma. Although the overall coloration makes identification difficult, this shape is telling.

      - name: <i>Mecaphesa asperata</i>
        id: m-asperate
        imgPrefix: tma
        common: Northern Crab Spider
        description: This spider is able to change its coloration noticeably and may be green or yellow overall. However, it is distinguished by a pair of dark vertical stripes on its dorsal prosoma and, usually, reddish coloration on the middle parts of its elongated first and second legs. The opisthosoma may be a brighter yellow with mirrored reddish markings.
        notes: This spider is widely found in North America and can commonly be seen in wait on flowers or leaves.
        captions:
        - Yellow <i>Mecaphesa asperata</i> waiting for prey on a flower, with a very small ant approaching. Note the faint dark stripes on the opisthosoma.
        - The same <i>M. asperata</i> pictured from the side. While the legs are uniformly colored, the leg spines and opisthosoma markings give this species away.
        - A greenish northern crab spider on a sunflower. This species can take several days to change color, so this specimen may be in the process of improving its camouflage.
