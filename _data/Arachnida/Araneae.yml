        common: Twin Flagged Jumping Spider
        description: A very common jumping spider in central Texas, <i>Anasaitas canosa</i> is found from Mexico to the American Southeast. Primarily black and white in coloration, this spider is named for the pair of white spots present on the dorsal cephalothorax of males and females. But this species actually has numerous pairs of high-contrast markings all down its dorsal side and on its pedipalps.
        captions: 
        - Grey and black jumping spider with mirrored white markings scouting on a dead leaf.
        - The same <i>Anasaitas canosa</i> on a stone, partially camouflaged.
        - Tentatively identified as <i>A. canosa</i> by the coloration of the legs and pedipalps, but without photos from other angles it is difficult to be confident.
        - A small specimen which found its way onto a book on my coffee table.
        - <i>A. canosa</i> seen on an outdoor fence, looking directly at camera. Taken with Sony a7.

        common: Brilliant Jumping Spider
        description: This species is brightly colored, but males and females have very different colorations. The Pixel 5 images below are very likely a female <i>P. clarus</i>, but both hue and pattern are remarkably variable in this species, and there are no exact matches to any reference photos in Rose or online resources. But when range is considered, there are no other salticids I would consider.
        captions:
        - Fuzzy-looking orange and brown jumping spider found on a watering can.
        - The same <i>P. clarus</i> seen from the front, with silk dragline visible in the background.
        - Another shot of the same specimen after it turned to face the other direction.
      - name: Habronattus coecatus
        id: h-coecatus
        imgPrefix: shc
        description: Though males of genus Habronattus are quite colorful and are called "paradise spiders", females are largely grey and indistinct. <i>H. coecatus</i> happens to have the plainest females commonly found in my area, making the images below a likely identification (at least to the genus).
        captions:
        - Grey jumping spider with faint markings on a green leaf.
        - Front-facing shot of the same <i>Habronattus spp.</i>

        common: Red-spotted Ant Mimic
        description: Known to run on six legs, using its front pair as antennae similar to ants, this species is sometimes said to use that behavior to trick ants into letting it get close enough to prey on them. However, I will note that I have never seen a reference for this factoid and it seems dubious, given that the spider is much larger than even soldier-caste leaf cutter ants in central Texas and not color or shaped like them.
        captions:
        - A fast-running, hairless black spider hiding from me under a hopelessly small twig.
        - The same <i>C. descripta</i>, with large red opisthosoma marking clearly visible, sheltering beside a piece of bark.
  - name: Oxyopidae
    species:
      - name: Peucetia viridans
        id: p-viridans

        common: Green Lynx Spider
        description: Hard to mistake, this spider is vivid green, blending in effectively with certain leaves (and standing out sorely from duller plants). Though there is one jumping spider with similar shape and coloration, <i>P. viridans</i> has long leg spines visible to the naked eye and sometimes white, yellow, pink, or red chevrons marking its opisthosoma. As with all Oxyopidae, the eight eyes are small and arranged somewhat hexagonally, but <i>P. viridans</i> bears them in a tight grouping around a dark spot at the top of its prosoma.
        captions:
        - Bright green spider with long legs blending in with sweet potato leaves. Despite missing two legs, it has captured a house fly as prey.
        - The same specimen, still missing two legs, having captured a fruit fly the next day.
        - A vivid <i>P. viridans</i> with barely visible chevron markings, resting in excellent camouflage on a basil leaf.
        - An extraordinarily large and colorful specimen (likely female based on size), holding a first tarsus to its chelicerae.
        - Another shot of the same specimen, with brightly colored and distinct chevrons visible.
