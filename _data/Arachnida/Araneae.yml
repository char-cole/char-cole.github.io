    species:
      - name: <i>Anasaitas canosa</i>
        id: a-canosa
        imgPrefix: sac
        common: Twin Flagged Jumping Spider
        description: A small jumping spider with black, white, and grey coloration. Its name is a reference to mirrored pairs of white spots found on its pedipalps and dorsal prosoma, making this spider easily identifiable. First legs are mostly black; other legs have more pronounced splotches or banding of grey and black. This species has a wider stance than many other jumping spiders.
        notes: A very common jumping spider in central Texas, <i>Anasaitas canosa</i> is found from Mexico to the American Southeast.
        captions: 
        - <i>Anasaitas canosa</i> with distinctive pattern of mirrored white markings traveling across a dead leaf.
        - The same <i>A canosa</i> on a stone, partially camouflaged.
        - Tentatively identified as <i>A. canosa</i> by the coloration of the legs and pedipalps, but without photos from other angles it is difficult to be confident.
        - A small specimen which found its way onto a book on my coffee table.

      - name: <i>Phidippus clarus</i>
        id: p-clarus
        imgPrefix: spc
        common: Brilliant Jumping Spider
        description: This species is brightly colored, but males and females have very different colorations. Males are mostly black, with vivid blue chelicerae, red opisthosoma markings, and white leg bands. Female coloration is a combination of orange, brown, and tan. Both morphs are covered in short hairs giving a fuzzy appearance.
        captions:
        - Bright and fuzzy <i>Phidippus clarus</i> jumping spider found on a watering can.
        - The same <i>P. clarus</i> seen from the front, with silk dragline visible in the background.
        - Another shot of the same specimen after it turned to face the other direction.
      - name: <i>Habronattus coecatus</i>
        id: h-coecatus
        imgPrefix: shc
        description: Though males of genus <i>Habronattus</i> are quite colorful and are called "paradise spiders", females are largely grey and indistinct. <i>H. coecatus</i> happens to have the plainest females commonly found in my area, making the images below a likely but uncertain identification.
        captions:
        - Grey female jumping spider with indistinct markings, likely <i>Habronattus coecatus</i>, on a green leaf.
        - Front-facing shot of the same <i>Habronattus</i> sp.
      - name: <i>Hentzia palmarum</i>
        id: h-palmarum
        common: Common Hentz Jumper
        imgPrefix: shp
        description: Highly sexually dimorphic. Males have long, dark first legs and broad white bands around their brown bodies, as well as large pedipalps white white bands. Females are mostly a pale tan color with less distinct first legs.
        captions:
        - Adult male <i>H. palmarum</i> climbing up my shirt.
      - name: <i>Metacyrba taeniola</i>
        id: m-taeniola
        imgPrefix: smt
        description: Very dark brown to black overall. Below the femurs, the legs are red-brown. The first legs are robust and more black. A thin white line circles the prosoma and two broken white lines mark the opisthosoma.
        notes: Appearance is similar to other species of <i>Metacyrba</i>, but can be distinguished by the shape of the white markings and the leg coloration, as well as being larger. Sometimes considered to have two subspecies, <i>M. taeniola taeniola</i> and <i>M. taeniola similis</i>.
        captions:
        - In this photo <i>Metacyrba taeniola</i>'s characteristic white dorsal markings can be seen, as well as distinct black and dark amber sections of the leg.
        - This image of a <i>M. taeniola</i> shows the coloration and markings distinctly, with nice detail on the leg hairs.
        - This specimen was dangling from a silk drop line indoors and adjusting its position frequently, often raising or lowering itself.
        - Here the specimen has everted its entire body to manipulate its drop line. Notice also the "scattered light hairs on the femur" (Rose, 2022) of the first legs.


  - name: corinnidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Castianeira descripta</i>
        id: c-descripta
        imgPrefix: ccd
        common: Red-spotted Ant Mimic
        description: This spider is black, nearly hairless, and has a large red mark over most of its opisthosoma, causing it to potentially be misidentified as a black widow. It will often be seen with its first legs extended in front of it like antennae.
        notes: Known to run on six legs, using its front pair as antennae similar to ants, this species is sometimes said to use that behavior to trick ants into letting it get close enough to prey on them. However, I will note that I have never seen a reference for this factoid and it seems dubious, given that the spider is much larger than almost any ants in central Texas and not colored or shaped like them. Typical of Corinnidae, this species is a fast runner.
        captions:
        - <i>Castianeira descripta</i> seen running on an urban street, attempting to hide from me under a very small plant stem.
        - The same <i>C. descripta</i>, with large red opisthosoma marking clearly visible, sheltering beside a piece of bark.
      - name: <i>Falconina gracilis</i>
        id: f-gracilis
        imgPrefix: cfg
        description: The prosoma is smooth and dark-brown to black. The opisthosoma can be the same color or paler brown, and has distinct, mirrored pale spots. The legs are more thin and brown.
        notes: Only found in southern California and near the gulf coast, this species has no common name.
        captions:
        - An adult <i>Falconina gracilis</i> seen running along the ground at night. It moved very quickly, and periodically stopped and appeared to plunge its chelicerae down into the soil.

  - name: oxyopidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Peucetia viridans</i>
        id: p-viridans
        imgPrefix: opv
        common: Green Lynx Spider
        description: Hard to mistake, this spider is vivid green, blending in effectively with certain leaves (and standing out sorely from duller plants). Though there is one jumping spider with similar shape and coloration, <i>P. viridans</i> has long leg spines visible to the naked eye and sometimes white, yellow, pink, or red chevrons marking its opisthosoma. As with all Oxyopidae, the eight eyes are small and arranged somewhat hexagonally, but <i>P. viridans</i> bears them in a tight grouping around a dark spot at the top of its prosoma.
        captions:
        - <i>Peucetia viridans</i> blending in well with sweet potato leaves. Despite missing two legs, it has captured a house fly as prey.
        - The same specimen, still missing two legs, having captured a fruit fly the next day.
        - A vivid <i>P. viridans</i> with barely visible chevron markings, resting in excellent camouflage on a basil leaf.
        - An extraordinarily large and colorful specimen (likely female based on size), holding a first tarsus to its chelicerae.
        - Another shot of the same specimen, with brightly colored and distinct chevrons visible.

  - name: theraphosidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Aphonopelma anax</i>
        id: a-anax
        imgPrefix: taa
        common: Texas Tan Tarantula
        description: Confusingly named, this spider is best identified by contrasting its very dark legs with its tan body. The Texas Brown Tarantula, on the other hand, is more evenly brown all over. However, Rose[1] seems to describe both as the same species with high variation.
        notes: Females of this genus can live at least 4 decades and rarely leave their dens; males wander in spring and fall looking for mates, and only survive a couple years at maturity.
        captions:
        - A poor picture taken in surprise, at a distance, of a (probably male) <i>Aphonopelma</i> sp. out wandering Davis Mountains State Park in September.

    species:
      - name: <i>Rabidosa rabida</i>
        id: r-rabida
        imgPrefix: lrr
        common: Rabid Wolf Spider
        description: Primarily tan with brown marking, this species has long legs and a flat posture. Although many wolf spiders look similar to the untrained eye, there are key details which make this species unmistakable. If seen from the front, narrow brown vertical stripes extend the length of the center of its chelicerae. If seen from above, the median (central) dark band extends all the way down the opisthosoma to the spinnerets and contains faint tan chevrons toward the latter end.
        notes: Despite its absurdly fearsome name, this spider is not especially aggressive or dangerous in any way. Nor, in fact, is it rare. In my personal experience it is by far the most common spider in urban and suburban central Texas. Take a headlamp into any yard or open area at night and see the grass light up; each point is almost certainly a set of <i>Rabidosa rabida</i> eyes.
        captions:
        - <i>Rabidosa rabida</i> seen at night on a concrete sidewalk. Note the distinctive chevrons on the median dark band. The small size of the opisthosoma indicates a male; the dark front legs indicate a mature male.
        - This Rabid Wolf Spider was disturbed by the grass being cut and retreated up onto the side of an urban house. This specimen clearly displays another identifying feature, a "feathered" pattern in the lateral dark bands of the opisthosoma. The large opisthosoma indicates a female.
        - Though not easily determined from the photo, this was the largest <i>R. rabida</i> I have ever seen; it was spotted in a suburban garden at night in a yard full of dozens of other specimens. Note the high contrast between the pale chelicerae and the dark stripes running down them. As a mature specimen, this must be female because its legs are all the same color.
        - A roughly lit specimen seen by a paved urban nature trail at night. In addition to the visible chelicerae stripes and the lateral band "feathering", the mature male's dark first legs are unique to this species.
      - name: <i>Schizocosa ocreata</i>
        id: s-ocreata
        imgPrefix: lso
        common: Brushlegged Wolf Spider
        description: Common among Lycosidae, this species has a central cream- or tan-colored band down its prosoma with dark brow bands to either side. In this species, the central band is wider than in many others, and the darker bands do not contain prominent radial lines (as in members of genus Hogna, for example). This species also has "hairier" legs than most other Lycosidae. However, as with most wolf spiders, members of Schizocosa are difficult to confidently identify without microscopic examination.
        captions:
        - Though not certain without seeing the opisthosoma (obscured by young), I believe this adult female spider on my porch is an example of <i>Schizocosa ocreata</i>.
        - A closer picture of this <i>S. ocreata</i>'s young clinging on to their mother. Wolf spider young look somewhat like greenish nodules when riding on their mother, but closer examination reveals their tangled legs.

  - name: theridiidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Latrodectus geometricus</i>
        id: l-geometricus
        imgPrefix: tlg
        common: Brown Widow Spider
        description: This spider is reported to have highly variable coloration, but is typically yellow-brown or tan. The signature hourglass can range from yellow to red. Typical of a widow spider, this species is hairless and has long, delicate legs.
        notes: Native to Africa, this species has been introduced to Europe and North America by humans. This species may have painful venom, but its bite is not as dangerous as that of a black widow. Some research indicates that brown widows are displacing native western black widows in southern California, to the possible benefit of humans (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1603/ME11285">Journal of Medical Entomology</a>).
        captions:
        - Probable <i>Latrodectus geometricus</i> spotted in a characteristic "tangle web" over a small hollow in the transition zone between the Mojave & Colorado deserts of southern California.
        - Pedipalps focused - This specimen appears to have large, prominent pedipalps, indicating it a mature male.
        - Hourglass focused - Note the signature hourglass shape on the ventral opisthosoma. Although the overall coloration makes identification difficult, this shape is telling.
      
      - name: <i>Theridion murarium</i>
        id: t-murarium
        imgPrefix: ttm
        description: Females have a very large, nearly spherical opisthosoma. First legs are longer than others. Prosoma is primarily tan to red. Legs are pale with tan or dark bands, with medium hairs. Opisthosoma is speckled brown with a wide, pale median band bordered by thick dark lines running the entire length on the anterior side.
        notes: This genus may be very difficult to confidently identify without microscopic examination of genitalia. In the particular specimen I've photographed, I got no clear shots of the prosoma, so identification can't be certain.
        captions:
        - This specimen is likely a female member of genus <i>Theridion</i>, and probably <i>T. murarium</i> based on the distinct patterning. However, the prosoma is far more red than others identified online; this could easily be result of dietary factors though.
        - Quite skittish, this spider was difficult to photograph in its web. It frequently retreated to a crevice in the wall when I approached. Here it can be seen in a defensive posture with its legs retracted.

  - name: thomisidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Mecaphesa asperata</i>
        id: m-asperata
        imgPrefix: tma
        common: Northern Crab Spider
        description: This spider is able to change its coloration noticeably and may be green or yellow overall. However, it is distinguished by a pair of dark vertical stripes on its dorsal prosoma and, usually, reddish coloration on the middle parts of its elongated first and second legs. The opisthosoma may be a brighter yellow with mirrored reddish markings.
        notes: This spider is widely found in North America and can commonly be seen in wait on flowers or leaves.
        captions:
        - Yellow <i>Mecaphesa asperata</i> waiting for prey on a flower, with a very small ant approaching. Note the faint dark stripes on the opisthosoma.
        - The same <i>M. asperata</i> pictured from the side. While the legs are uniformly colored, the leg spines and opisthosoma markings give this species away.
        - A greenish northern crab spider on a sunflower. This species can take several days to change color, so this specimen may be in the process of improving its camouflage.

  - name: tetragnathidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Leucauge argyrobapta</i>
        id: l-argyrobapta
        imgPrefix: tla
        common: Mabel Orchard Orb Weaver
        notes: This species is almost identical to <i>L. venusta</i> and requires microscopic examination of the genitalia for positive identification. In addition, there is some overlap in their ranges. However, a rule of thumb is that <i>L. argyrobapta</i> is expected when close to the Gulf Coast or in Florida, while <i>L. venusta</i> is seen futher north.
        description: This orb weaver has a high, ovaloid opisthosoma which is yellow and white with dark stripes on the dorsal side. Legs are green with yellow joints. Copper-colored (sometimes red or yellow) chevron on ventral side can have metallic sheen.
        captions:
        - Inverted mabel orchard orb weaver photographed in its web with a clear view of the ventral chevron.
        - <i>Leucauge argyrobapta</i> photographed out-of-focus to demonstrate the chevron's highly reflective coloration.
        - Resident <i>L. argyrobapta</i> seen from the side while resting in its web.
        - A (probably juvenile) mabel orchard orb weaver in a damaged web, its dorsal markings visible. Note the pale green color if its prosoma and legs.
        - Found in the mountains of North Carolina, this is probably <i>Leucauge venusta</i>, the orchard orb weaver, resting in its web. This specimen's legs are distinctly green.
  
  - name: araneidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Gasteracantha cancriformis</i>
        id: g-cancriformis
        imgPrefix: agc
        common: Spiny Orb Weaver
        notes: This species has many common names, such as Spiny-backed Orb Weaver, Smiley Face Spider, Crablike Orb Weaver, and variations of these. The taxonomic name indicates all of these - <i>Gasteracantha</i> means "thorned belly" while <i>cancriformis</i> means "crab-shaped". Note however that "crab spider" usually refers to an entirely different family, Thomisidae. <i>G. cancriformis</i> is widespread in the Americas.
        description: This species can vary in color signifcantly. The legs and prosoma are always black, and quite small relative to the opisthosoma, giving this spider an appearance like an actor in a morph suit and costume. The large opisthosoma has six spikes around the edge and a symmetrical pattern of black spots across the dorsal surface, sometimes looking like a smiple smiley face icon. The surface can be white, to yellow, to red; the spikes can be black or red.
        captions:
        - Yellow <i>Gasteracantha cancriformis</i> morph seen at the edge of an urban woodland in its web.
        - A closer view of the dorsal decoration of this yellow specimen - note the "smiley face" pattern.

  - name: agelenidae
    species:
      - name: <i>Barronopsis</i> sp.
        id: b-sp
        imgPrefix: absp
        notes: Members of this genus cannot be confidently identified without examination of microscopic genitalia, as several extremely similar species live in the USA, but the images below are most likely <i>Barronopsis texana</i> based on its range. However, it is also possible some are <i>Agelenopsis</i>, "grass spiders," which looks similar. However, these two were found in lairs at chest height, in tree branches.
        description: This spider has regular dark bands on its legs as well as two dark stripes down the dorsal prosoma. It has dark spots around its eyes and a "mustache" or "smiley face" marking below.
        captions:
        - Captured with my Sony a7 II, this specimen can be better identified as a member of <i>Barronopsis</i>. Here its dorsal patterns are on display, clearly distinguishing it from another common genus <i>Agelenopsis</i>, which looks more similar to <i>Rabidosa rabida</i>.
        - A second shot of the same specimen, focusing on its prosoma.
        - This web was found at around chest height in urban woods.
        - Another (likely) <i>Barronopsis texana</i>, photographed from the side, also found in tree branches.
      - name: <i>Agelenopsis</i> sp.
        id: a-sp
        imgPrefix: aasp
        notes: Members of this genus cannot be confidently identified without examination of microscopic genitalia, as several extremely similar species live in the USA. Additionally, this genus looks similar to <i>Barronopsis</i>, so I may have confused images of the two. However, each of these spiders was found in a lair in the grass, and this genus is known as "grass spiders". Additionally, these do not have the characteristic "smiley face" apparent on the <i>Barronopsis</i>.
        captions:
        - The first <i>Agelenopsis</i> I found, illuminated with a headlamp and captured with a Pixel 5.
        - The second <i>Agelenopsis</i> I found in the woods near my home. Some of its eyes can be spotted by the reflection of my headlamp.
        - Grass spider tightly packed in its lair in the grass. Like many web-living spiders, it will only flee if and when its web is touched.
        - One of many other (likely) <i>Agelenopsis</i> living in a web lair in the grass that same day. In some areas, there were up to 6 lairs in arms' reach.
