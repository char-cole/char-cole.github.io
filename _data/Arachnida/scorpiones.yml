        common: Striped Bark Scorpion
        description: The striped bark scorpion is pale tan all over with two broad, dark lines running parallel down the dorsal side of the carapace. It also has a dark triangle around the eyes. They also have narrow pedipalps (used as pincers) and stinger. Adults of this species are less than 3 inches in length.
        notes: This scorpion is extremely common and is found in a variety of biomes, from deserts to forests. <i>C. vittatus</i> has a painful and dangerous sting. Like all true scorpions, the striped bark scorpion glows bright cyan under ultraviolet (UV) light. Reasons for this effect are yet unknown.
