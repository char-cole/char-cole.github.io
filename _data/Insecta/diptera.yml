          - An injured robber fly resting on the sidewalk in late summer. Although I beleive it was alive, it did not respond to any motion or light touch.
          - The fly is clearly missing most of its left first leg, perhaps a recent injury. The charateristic "dip" between its enormous eyes and of course its single pair of wings are hallmarks of a true fly.
          - A different robber fly is here found dead, grasping its prey, a paper wasp. I've lifted them on a twid for a better view but the lighting was poor.
          - Placed back on the ground, the robber fly and its prey can be clearly seen. Although on a bike path they do not appear crushed so it is unclear what killed them.
