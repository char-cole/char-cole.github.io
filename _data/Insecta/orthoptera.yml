        description: <i>Aidemona azteca</i> is a grasshopper notable for its vivid coloration and compact, cherubic shape as a nymph. They are quite small, but actually fairly common in areas where they live. As they mature, their carapace turns mottled grey-brown and they shape lengthens into a much more traditional and unremarkable grasshopper appearance.
