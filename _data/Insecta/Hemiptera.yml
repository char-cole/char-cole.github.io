        description: Primary color is orange, dark orange, reddish-orange, or deep red. Has long, uniformly black legs. Appears hairless, but very small white "hairs" can be seen over the body and legs. Several columns of white dots line the body as the nymph matures. Wings are uniformly black. Long proboscis, tucked underneath body, is uniformly black.
        notes: Named for its resemblance to the milkweed bug. Widely found from the southern US to South America. Rather than a pest, this insect is known to predate on agricultural pest species and is considered beneficial.
