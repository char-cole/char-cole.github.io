<h1>Photography Catalogue</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to my photography catalogue, where I record encounters with many of
    my favorite creatures. Typically, these are invertebrate animals such as
    insects and spiders.

    ðŸ“… This section of the site currently updated on a weekly basis as
    I comb through my growing backlog of photos. One or more specimens will be
    described each weekend.
    <br />
    <br />
    ðŸŽ² There is no order to my identification and documentation process, and new
    specimens aren't prioritized. There will not be spiders every week.
    <br />
    <br />
    ðŸ—ƒ Many older specimens may never be uploaded as I can't identify them or don't have good
    enough photos - eventually, I may create a section for those. Perhaps the
    reader can help identify some of them!

<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>

<h3 id="arachnida"><a href="arachnida">Class Arachnida</a> (arachnids)</h3>
<p>
    My most common subject is spiders (order Araneae), although this section
    also contains a handful of subjects from other orders of class Arachnida. I
    convinced myself to overcome a terrible case of arachnophobia when I was
    younger so that I could travel and spend more time in nature. After becoming
    comfortable around spiders, over time I came to feel tremendous respect and
    fascination for them. Because they are badly misunderstood by the public,
    and because there are many resources for spider identification, I now make
    spidering one of my main hobbies. The primary purpose of this catalogue is
    to be a repository for my spider identifications.
</p>

<h3 id="insecta"><a href="insecta">Class Insecta</a> (insects)</h3>
<p>
    Before I developed such a deep interest in spiders, I was photographing
    insects. With such tremendous variety in their forms, insects make excellent
    subjects. Indeed some of my favorite animals are hymenoptera (ants, bees,
    and wasps) and coleoptera (beetles). This section is smaller and receives
    fewer updates than arachnida, but contains some of my favorite images. (And,
    for arachnophobic readers, this section may be more enjoyable.)
</p>

<h3 id="microbes"><a href="microbes">misc. microbes</a></h3>
<p>
    The diversity of microbial life one can see in ordinary samples is very
    high, spread across all kingdoms and domains of life. This section contains
    algae, plants, bacteria, animals, fungus, and more. (Technically, so do the
    others, but they focus on the animals.) In addition, identification of these
    organisms is much more difficult, so I'm rarely able to be very specific.

    Most of my photos were taken on a

    - these are typically distinguishable by a very shallow focus (where most of
    the subject will be out of focus and the background will have pronounced

    lens. These have allowed me to capture detail and shots impossible for a
    smartphone, but the learning curve is significant.
</p>

<p>
    My

    >
    has a 10x eyepiece lens and four objective lenses at 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x.
    The total magnification of the subject is thus from 40x to 1000x. However,
    all photos taken through my microscope are taken with my Pixel 5 and further
    magnified by its lens.

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>
    <b>Macro photography</b> is the practice of photographing very small
    organisms or objects with very high magnification so the subject appears
    greater than life size. Other terms for this include
    <b>microphotography</b> (but this can also mean the practice of shrinking
    physical photographs to tiny sizes), <b>photomacrography</b>, or
    <b>macrography</b>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Microscopy</b> is the practice of using a microscope. Although taking
    photos through a microscope is a form of macro photography, it also has a
    specific name: <b>photomicrography</b>.
</p>
